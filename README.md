**Atmosfear** is a data science group project that explores the global
challenge of air pollution and its impact on public health. Our goal is to
uncover patterns in how different pollutants dominate across world cities and
how these patterns relate to regional trends in respiratory and cardiovascular
illnesses. By identifying these pollutant profiles and their health
correlations, we aim to fill a critical research gap and hopefully support
more targeted, pollutant-specific policy interventions.

Air pollution is one of the most underestimated killers in the world today.
Unlike more visible threats, polluted air is invisible and easy to ignore
until it becomes personal. You can't see it, but it's there: silently entering
lungs, aggravating asthma, triggering heart conditions, and cutting lives
short.

According to the WHO (2023) and GBD (2024), air pollution contributes to an
estimated **7 million premature deaths each year** due to its strong links
with cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, stroke, and lung cancer. It's
not just an environmental crisis; it's a public health emergency hiding in
plain sight.

One of our group members shared a personal story: her mother, who has asthma,
experiences severe discomfort when staying in cities where it is polluted.
Even short visits can mean weeks of relying on medications, constant coughing,
and the simple wish to breathe without pain. For her and millions with
similar and different health conditions, clean air isn’t just a preference,
it’s a necessity.  
**But is it feasible to find cities where the air is truly safe for
vulnerable individuals?**

A brief overview of our shared insights on global air pollution, its health
impacts, and why a deeper pollutant-specific analysis is needed.

A focused review of key pollutants, global exposure trends, and the
limitations of current metrics like the AQI.

Among the top global cities with the highest average AQI in **(Timeframe)**,
how do respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalization rates differ based on
the city’s dominant air pollutant? (place holder for later)
