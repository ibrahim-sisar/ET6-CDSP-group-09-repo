# Group Norms

💠 **Our Shared Purpose**  
We want our group to be a space where everyone feels respected, safe,  
and encouraged to grow. We believe in working together honestly,  
listening with care, and staying open to different ideas. Our aim is  
to build trust, do our best, and support each other as a team.

🗣️ **Communication & Respect**  
We speak with kindness and listen with full attention.

Every voice matters — all ideas are treated with respect; we focus on  
what is said, not who says it.

We ask questions freely and express our views without fear of judgment.

Disagreements are natural; we focus on resolving issues, not blaming  
people.

Open dialogue is encouraged — curiosity and understanding come before  
conclusions.

🔍 **Constructive Discussions & Debate**  
We define clear goals before a discussion or debate begins.

All opinions are welcome — even those different from our own.

Debates are not competitions; they are opportunities to explore together.

If we reach a standstill, we’ll vote or turn to a neutral member for  
guidance.

We stay respectful, positive, and growth-minded throughout. We will  
engage in debates with a respectful and positive attitude, focusing on  
ideas rather than individuals, and striving for constructive outcomes.

When reviewing code or project-related content, we focus on the work  
itself — not on the person who wrote it. Feedback should be constructive,  
respectful, and aimed at improving the overall outcome.

🤝 **Trust & Team Connection**  
We start from a place of trust — everyone is here to contribute and grow.

Mistakes are part of learning; we respond with support, not judgment.

If trust is broken, we commit to resolving it openly and respectfully.

Sharing personal moments, stories, or humor strengthens our connection.

We each take responsibility for our roles and reach out for help when  
needed.

🕒 **Time & Responsibility**  
We respect each other’s time by being punctual and prepared.

Meetings will be planned collaboratively, choosing times that work best  
for most.

Deadlines are important, but transparency and collaboration come first.

We value steady contribution over constant presence. Share workload  
fairly and adjust regularly using check-ins and project boards.

🔁 **Flexibility & Growth**  
Plans may change, and that’s okay — we adjust together.

Feedback is a gift — we use it to improve, not to criticize.

We embrace learning at every stage and encourage each other’s  
development.

We’ll revisit and update these norms as needed to reflect how we’re  
evolving.
