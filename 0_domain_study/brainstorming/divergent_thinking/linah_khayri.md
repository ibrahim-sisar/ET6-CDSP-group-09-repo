## 🌞 Domain: Solar Energy in Socioeconomic Context

🎯 Research Question (Possible):
How do cost factors and socioeconomic development influence the adoption of solar
energy in developed vs. developing countries?

📊 Key Data Factors & Sources

1. Installed Solar Energy Capacity (MW)
What it tells us: Annual solar installation capacity by country.  
Source: IRENA Renewable Capacity Statistics  
2. Access to Electricity (% of Population)  
What it tells us: Percentage of the population with electricity access in each
country.  
Source: World Bank – Electricity Access Indicator  
3. GDP per Capita (US$)  
What it tells us: Average income per person — helps distinguish between developed
and developing countries.  
Source: World Bank – GDP per Capita  

🧹Data Preparation Notes  

Each dataset focuses on a single topic.  
To explore relationships, we must:

- Match data by country and year
- Merge into one master file
- Clean inconsistencies (e.g., mismatched country names, missing data)
  
>⚠️We may need to search for additional factors (e.g., solar radiation, policy
incentives, installation costs).

✅ Pros  

- Easy to access and clean (CSV available from IRENA & World Bank)
- Standardized global data with broad temporal and geographic coverage
- Enables socioeconomic comparisons (developed vs. developing countries)
- Aligns with sustainability and energy justice themes (e.g., UN SDGs)
- Suitable for correlation and trend analysis
- Feasible within project timeline

⚠️ Cons

- Shows correlation, not causation
- Limited to country-level data (no regional or household granularity)
- Still requires data cleaning
- May lack key context (e.g., government policies, sunlight availability,
installation cost)
