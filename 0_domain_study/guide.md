# 🌍 Domain Study: Global Air Pollution

Welcome to the domain study folder for our research on **air pollution and its
 effects on respiratory and cardiovascular health** across global cities. This
 folder organizes everything we've learned about the research area, and it's
 meant to help any new reader quickly understand the key concepts, brainstorming
and background review.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Folder

This folder includes:

- Brainstorming
- Background summaries about air pollution and health
- Summary of our understanding
- Key terms and pollutant definitions
- Helpful articles, PDFs, and links

---

## What You’ll Find Here

### 1. `background_review.md`

Summary of current understanding of:

- Air Pollution as a Global Health Crisis
- Major Pollutants and Their Health Pathways
- Why Focus on the Dominant Pollutant?
- Regional Signatures and Pollution Sources
- The Pollutant Composition Index (PCI)
- Beyond Exposure: Integrating Health Burden Data
- Analytical Value and Research Gap

### 2. `key_terms.md`

Definitions and short explanations of key domain concepts:

- AQI (Air Quality Index)
- Dominant pollutant
- Respiratory vs. cardiovascular diseases

### 4. `resources_links.md`

A list of:

- Data sources (e.g., WHO, OpenAQ, IHME)
- Articles or reports that helped us understand the domain

## 📌 How This Helps Our Research

Understanding the domain lets us:

- Know what has already been studied
- Make sure our research question aligns the FRESCO & PICOT evaluation

This folder gives context to our question:  
**"How do respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes vary across global cities
 categorized by their dominant air pollutant?"**
